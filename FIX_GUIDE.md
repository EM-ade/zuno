# Zuno Platform - Image URLs and Wallet Connection Fixes

## Issue 1: Carousel Images Not Loading

### Problem
The image URLs stored in the database are pointing to IPFS directories instead of the actual image files.

**Example of the issue:**
- Stored URL: `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/[hash]/`
- Actual image: `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/[hash]/images/nft_2.png`

### Solution

#### Quick Fix - Run the Image URL Fixer
```bash
# Check current image URLs
GET http://localhost:3000/api/fix/image-urls?collectionId=YOUR_COLLECTION_ID

# Fix the URLs automatically
POST http://localhost:3000/api/fix/image-urls
{
  "collectionId": "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID"
}
```

#### Permanent Fix - Update Upload Process
The issue occurs during the upload process when folder structures are uploaded. The fix involves:

1. **For new uploads**: Ensure the full image path is saved, not just the directory hash
2. **For existing items**: Use the `/api/fix/image-urls` endpoint to correct the URLs

### How to Fix Existing Collections

1. **Check which items need fixing:**
```javascript
// Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/fix/image-urls
// This will show you items with directory URLs vs actual image URLs
```

2. **Run the fix for a specific collection:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/fix/image-urls', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    collectionId: '2oHb8hVPBC2B3FQu6TT7puKGc7sf1ovxaMrsAMYjuovT'
  })
})
```

3. **The fix will:**
- Check if URLs are directories (no file extension)
- Try to construct the correct image path
- Test if the constructed URL is accessible
- Update the database with the correct URL

## Issue 2: Phantom Wallet Connection Issues

### Problem
Wallet connections, especially with Phantom, are unreliable and sometimes fail.

### Root Causes
1. Network mismatch (was using Devnet instead of Mainnet)
2. AutoConnect causing race conditions
3. No retry logic for failed connections
4. Insufficient timeout for transaction confirmations

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Updated WalletContext.tsx
- Changed from Devnet to Mainnet
- Disabled autoConnect for better control
- Added connection testing on mount
- Increased transaction timeout to 60 seconds
- Added error handling for specific wallet issues

#### 2. Connection Configuration
```javascript
// Now using:
- Network: Mainnet-beta
- Commitment: 'confirmed'
- Timeout: 60000ms (60 seconds)
- AutoConnect: false (manual control)
```

#### 3. Better Error Handling
The wallet now handles specific errors:
- User rejection
- Phantom-specific issues
- Connection timeouts

### How to Test Wallet Connection

1. **Clear browser cache and Phantom extension cache**
2. **Ensure Phantom is unlocked before connecting**
3. **Check console for connection status:**
   - Should see: "Solana connection established: {version}"
   - Any errors will be logged with specific details

### Troubleshooting Phantom Connection

If Phantom still has issues:

1. **Check Phantom is on correct network:**
   - Open Phantom
   - Settings → Change Network → Mainnet Beta

2. **Clear Phantom cache:**
   - Settings → Advanced → Clear Cache

3. **Try manual connection:**
```javascript
// In browser console
const { solana } = window;
if (solana?.isPhantom) {
  await solana.connect();
}
```

## Additional Improvements

### For Heavy Load Handling
Based on your requirement for handling multiple users simultaneously:

1. **Database Optimizations:**
   - Added indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Implemented connection pooling
   - Added caching layer for read-heavy operations

2. **API Optimizations:**
   - Request deduplication
   - Rate limiting
   - Partial success handling for batch operations

3. **Frontend Optimizations:**
   - Lazy loading for images
   - Prefetching for navigation
   - Optimistic UI updates

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Image URLs:
1. Visit a mint page with carousel
2. Check browser DevTools Network tab
3. Images should load from full paths, not directories

### Test Wallet Connection:
1. Disconnect wallet if connected
2. Clear browser cache
3. Click "Connect Wallet"
4. Select Phantom
5. Should connect within 2-3 seconds

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
SOLANA_NETWORK=mainnet-beta
```

## Summary

Both issues have been fixed:

1. **Image URLs**: Created an API endpoint to fix existing URLs and prevent future issues
2. **Wallet Connection**: Updated to Mainnet, improved error handling, and added retry logic

The platform should now handle images correctly and provide reliable wallet connections, especially with Phantom.
